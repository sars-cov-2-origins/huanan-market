- `glm_stats_wildlife_and_unkmeat.py` – as above, but now incorporating unknown meat vendors in addition to live mammal vendors

- `market_env_sample_analysis.R` – intra-market relative risk analysis, kde plotting of environmental positives and sampling locations

- `market_spatial_analyses.R` – script to compute the distance metrics to the Huanan market and perform statistical tests as well as robustness analyses 

- `wuhan_spatial_analysis.Rmd` – script that builds null distributions from the population density data downloaded from worldpop.org and calculates median and centroid distances to Huanan for the early december cases

- `market_supplement_testing` - supplementary analyses for intra-market statistical testing, relative risk analyses
